Thejury said it did find that  manyof Georgi a's registrationand elec tionla ws ``ar e outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . It recommended that Fulton legislatorsact `` to have these la ws studied and revised to theend of moderniz ing and improving them '' . The grand jury commented on a numberof other topics ,  among them theAtlant aand Ful ton County purchasing departments which itsaid `` are well  operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of bothgovern ments ''.
