      "> Even with the best of websites, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever encountered a scraping job that couldn\u2019t be described as *\u201cA small and simple general model with heaps upon  piles of annoying little exceptions\u201d* \n",

      "\n",
      "##What is it?\n",
      "\n",
      "A large portion of the data that we as social scientists are interested in resides on the web in manner. Web scraping is a method for pulling data from the structured (or not so structured!) HTML that makes up a web page. Python has numerous libraries for approaching this type of problem, many of which are incredibly powerful. If there is something you want to do, there's usually a way to accomplish it. Perhaps not easily, but it can be done. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "##How is it accomplished?\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, there are three problems that you might face when undertaking a scraping task:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. You have a single page, or a set of pages, that you know of and you want to scrape.\n",
      "2. You have a source that generates links, e.g., [RSS feeds](http://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml), to various pages with the same structure.\n",
      "3. You have a page that contains many pages of interest that are scattered across the file system and you only have general rules for reaching these pages. \n",
      "\n",
      "The key is that you must identify which type of problem you have. After this, you must look at the HTML structure of a webpage and construct a script that will select the parts of the page that are of interest to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "##There's a library for that! (Yea, I know...)\n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned previously, Python has various libraries for scraping tasks. The ones I have found the most useful are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- [pattern](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern)\n",
      "- [lxml](http://lxml.de/)\n",
      "- [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)\n",
      "- [Scrapy](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/0.16/)\n",
      "- [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition you need some method to examine the source of a webpage in a structured manner. I use Chrome which, as a WebKit browser, allows for \"Inspect Element\" functionality. Alternatively there is [Firebug](https://getfirebug.com/) for Firefox. I have no idea about Safari, Opera, or any other browser you wish to use. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, let's look at some [webpage source](http://names.mongabay.com/data/1000.html). This is a site that has a nice collection of statistics about first and last names.\n",

        "ERBIL, Iraq \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The extremist organization known as the Islamic State taunted the United States, in a video released Friday on jihadist websites, for its failed mission to rescue Western hostages held by the group in Syria.It also sought to persuade the United States and Britain that the only way to secure the release of their citizens held by the group is to negotiate a prisoner swap or pay ransoms, steps both governments have refused to take, saying they would encourage further kidnappings.The statements came in a new propaganda video featuring John Cantlie, a British journalist who was kidnapped two years ago and whom the group has been using as a spokesman in dispatches aimed at Western audiences.In the video, Mr. Cantlie recalled a failed military attempt by the United States to free him and his fellow captives from an Islamic State prison in northern Syria in July. Saying that it had involved dozens of commandos, helicopters and other aircraft, Mr. Cantlie estimated that it had taken weeks to prepare and cost millions of dollars.He said that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, had anticipated the raid and moved the captives beforehand, costing the group only \u00e2\u0080\u009ca few dollars in petrol.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe Obama administration first acknowledged the attempt in August, the day after ISIS released a video showing that the American journalist James Foley had been beheaded.The group has since beheaded four more Westerners: two Americans and two Britons.The group called on the United States and Britain to abandon their policies of not paying ransoms or negotiating prisoner swaps for civilian captives held by extremist groups.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy would you put all of those lives in danger when you could have peacefully negotiated like everyone else?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Cantlie asked in the video, referring to other Western governments that paid millions of dollars to secure the release of their citizens.The new surge in beheadings of Western captives has stirred debate over whether governments should pay ransoms.Last week, the Obama administration said that it was reviewing its policy on securing the release of American captives, but that the ban on paying ransoms would not change.Only three Western hostages are known to remain in ISIS custody, including Mr. Cantlie and an American aid worker whose name has not been made public. In the video, Mr. Cantlie said he was angry that his government had not negotiated his release, while most of about two dozen other captives previously held by the group have returned home.\u00e2\u0080\u009cLong ago, I accepted that my fate will overwhelmingly likely be the same as my cellmates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, calling Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to bring him home \u00e2\u0080\u009csome kind of ultimate betrayal.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMOSCOW \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Kiev on Friday condemned Russia for its \u00e2\u0080\u009cunacceptable\u00e2\u0080\u009d military intervention in Ukraine, while exhorting Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s newly elected government to complete its democratic and anticorruption reforms.During a joint news conference, Mr. Biden urged Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s president, Petro O. Poroshenko, to form a new government \u00e2\u0080\u009cin days, not weeks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and to champion economic reforms, promote further economic integration with the West and root out what Mr. Biden called \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe cancer of corruption.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven if the guns in the east fell silent tomorrow, Ukraine would still face a struggle for its democratic and economic future here in Kiev,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden said on the first anniversary of the beginning of public protests that led to the former government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ouster in February. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a lot of work to do in Kiev.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOne year after the Maidan, as the popular revolution is called in the country, Ukraine is mired in economic and military crises. Amid soaring inflation and capital flight, the $17 billion in loans promised to Ukraine by the International Monetary Fund \u00e2\u0080\u009cappears insufficient to close the external financing gap,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Timothy Ash, head of emerging-market research at Standard Bank, said in an investor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s note on Thursday.Meanwhile, international diplomatic efforts to halt the conflict in Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s southeast have faltered, with the West accusing Russia of continuing to supply men, money and weapons to the pro-Russian separatists.Mr. Biden called Moscow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula a \u00e2\u0080\u009cflagrant violation of the bedrock principles of the international system\u00e2\u0080\u009d and condemned the rebel-held elections on Nov. 2 as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cKremlin-orchestrated farce.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe also demanded that President Vladimir V. Putin cease backing the separatists.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo what you agreed to do, Mr. Putin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Biden said.More than 1,000 people have died since a cease-fire accord was signed on Sept. 5, according to new data released by the United Nations on Thursday. The conflict has left 4,317 dead and 9,921 wounded since mid-April, the report said.With NATO reporting that Russia is moving tanks, artillery and air-defense systems into the country, Ukrainian officials say they are prepared to repulse a new offensive.A Ukrainian military spokesman on Friday accused Russia of resuming shelling over the border for the first time since the cease-fire was signed.The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported Friday that a separatist leader in Donetsk, Igor Martinov, had confirmed that, since the summer, the separatists had received \u00e2\u0080\u009ca lot\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Russian money to help finance public services and pay wages and pensions that the Ukrainian government had cut off. He did not give a figure.Asked about the report, a German government spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said that the remarks confirmed the Western view of the Kremlin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in the crisis, despite Moscow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s denials of involvement.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military and financial support we simply wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the violent separatism that we are currently experiencing in these regions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Seibert said.Russia strongly denies providing material support to the rebels. It has also issued stern warnings to the West about delivering weapons to the Ukrainian government.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe that the United States is one of the initiators of this conflict,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Security Council, said on Thursday. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it sells weapons to them, the conflict will grow.\u00e2\u0080\u009dPresident Obama declined to supply lethal aid when Mr. Poroshenko requested it during his visit to Washington in September. But on Wednesday, the deputy national security adviser, Tony Blinken, said that lethal aid \u00e2\u0080\u009cremains on the table. It is something we are looking at.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Biden did not address lethal aid during his remarks on Friday, announcing only a further $20 million in aid for law enforcement and judicial reform.Also on Friday, the Dutch government announced that it had found new human remains and secured more wreckage from the Malaysia Airlines flight shot down in July. The crash killed all 298 people aboard. The situation at the wreckage site remained unstable, a statement on a government website said, and a team at the site would need several more days to complete its work.TUNIS \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Less than a month after electing a new Parliament, Tunisians will vote Sunday in their first-ever open democratic presidential election, completing a tumultuous democratic transition begun with their revolution nearly four years ago.The front-runner, Beji Caid Essebsi, who turns 88 next week, leads a field of 27 candidates that includes former dissidents and political prisoners, former officials from the dictatorship, a millionaire football boss, and a female magistrate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the only woman in the race.Mr. Essebsi has promised to restore the authority of the state and stability to a country that has struggled with economic malaise and a rise in Islamist terrorism since the overthrow of the autocratic president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali.For many Tunisians, weary of two years of sometimes chaotic rule by the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Islamist party, Ennahda, that followed the revolution, Mr. Essebsi is seen as a reassuring figure.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this period we need him, his capacity and his expertise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tarek Ben Slimen, a retired printer, shouting over the cheers at a rally in Tunis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is the one who created the political balance. If not for him, things would have been worse.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Essebsi is riding the success of his secular two-year-old party, Nidaa Tounes (Call for Tunisia), which gained the most seats in the legislative elections in October and will lead a coalition government.With a career spanning over 50 years, Mr. Essebsi served three times as minister, once as head of Parliament and as ambassador under both of Tunisia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authoritarian presidents, Habib Bourguiba and Mr. Ben Ali.His opponents, however, emphasize his age and his connections to the former government, raising fears that he is ushering in a return of officials from the Ben Ali era.Mr. Essebsi came out of retirement to head Nidaa Tounes, a collection of leftists, businessmen and former government officials united by their opposition to the Islamists.They led an effective campaign in the legislative elections urging voters to cast a tactical vote to prevent Ennahda from gaining a majority in Parliament. The strategy won Nidaa Tounes 86 seats to Ennadha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 69 in the assembly, according to final results announced Friday, not enough for a majority but giving it the lead in a coalition.The result has created a shift in Tunisia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s volatile transitional politics before the presidential elections. Ennahda has not fielded a candidate for the presidency, nor is it backing any candidate publicly, preferring to concentrate its efforts in the legislature.In the absence of the Islamists, some Tunisians are questioning whether Mr. Essebsi will gain too much power, if he leads both the legislative and executive branches.It was the first thing Mr. Essebsi addressed at a big rally in the capital last weekend, emphasizing his readiness to share power.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will try to work with other political parties because this is a sensitive period during which we need to show national unity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told supporters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Tunisian nation is a great and smart people, and it gave us a clear message saying that we should govern, but with help.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOne of his main challengers, Moncef Marzouki, is a longtime dissident, academic and human rights activist, who has served as president since shortly after the revolution in 2011. Mr. Marzouki, 69, has an informal style that has endeared him to some Tunisians and infuriated others.One morning this week he walked down the main street of the capital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roughest working-class neighborhood, Ettadhamen, greeting supporters and waving victory signs.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOthers are talking about the authority of the state,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told the crowd. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to talk about the authority of the people. It starts with you, your ideas, your freedoms. This Sunday marks an important date in history. Will you allow the old regime to come back or not?\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Marzouki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s party, the Congress for the Republic, fared badly in the legislative elections, punished for its role in Ennahda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coalition government, and only held on to four seats. Mr. Marzouki appealed to voters to look past their frustrations.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can be angry at your brother, and at your son, but still care about them and believe in them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are a nation of citizens who need a citizen president.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Marzouki is hoping to win support from Ennahda supporters, which could be enough to force the election to a second round. If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff between the two leading candidates will be held on Dec. 28.Another candidate, Hamma Hammami, 62, has been rising in the polls as head of the Communist Party and leader of the leftist alliance, the Popular Front.Mr. Hammami, a former political prisoner who comes from a poor farming region in Tunisia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s northwest, commands strong support among the working class and rural poor and is now making a bid for broader support.Commentators have singled him out as the candidate with enough national appeal to possibly defeat Mr. Essebsi if the election goes to a second round.Yet Mr. Essebsi has been clever enough to distance himself from the worst aspects of the Ben Ali period and to connect with the patriotic era of Tunisia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first president after independence, Mr. Bourguiba, who is better regarded.He has tapped the support of former officials by backing their return to political life and using their old networks to mobilize the vote for his party.Nevertheless, Mr. Essebsi has kept the senior or more notorious political figures from the Ben Ali era at arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s length, by sidelining them from leading any of the party lists, according to the political analyst Ridha Tlili, the director of the Ahmed Tlili Foundation for the Culture of Democracy.Mr. Essebsi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporters, young and old, praise his actions since the revolution, in overseeing Tunisia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first free elections in 2011 and offering Ennahda a way out of the political crisis of 2013, with fresh elections under a caretaker government, that avoided the bloodshed that many feared was looming.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are convinced Essebsi is the best,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Khalid el Bez, a student attending a rally for the candidate in Tunis. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe gave us the opportunity for a democratic election after the revolution, and he gave up power in a democratic way. Personally, I prefer an old guy who knows what he is doing to a young guy who does not.\u00e2\u0080\u009dLeaders of the United Nations and the World Health Organization expressed renewed alarm on Friday about Ebola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tenacity in Africa and in particular its potential to ravage a fourth country, Mali, where they said hundreds of people had been exposed to an infected cleric who died last month.At a webcast news conference from the World Bank offices in Washington, the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and the W.H.O.'s director general, Dr. Margaret Chan, also appeared to reset their schedules for containing the Ebola virus, which has sickened at least 15,351 people and killed 5,459, according to a W.H.O. update posted earlier Friday.Instead of restating their goal of safely burying 70 percent of the dead and treating 70 percent of the sick by Dec. 1, Mr. Ban said he hoped that the outbreak could be contained by the middle of next year.While the effort to halt the virus has made some progress, Mr. Ban said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe international response is outpaced by this Ebola spread.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWarning against any complacency, Dr. Chan added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must not forget: Ebola is a formidable enemy.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMost of the casualties are in the three most afflicted countries: Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.But the focus of the message of Mr. Ban and Dr. Chan was their concern about Mali, a vast country where the government does not have full control and where a United Nations peacekeeping force is deployed. At least six people in Mali have died of Ebola.A successful effort to halt Ebola infections in Mali last month, caused by an infected 2-year-old from Guinea, has now been overshadowed by a second and far more serious source of infection, from an imam from Guinea. He had been misdiagnosed with a kidney problem after traveling to Bamako, the capital, to seek treatment.Dr. Chan said nearly 500 people in Mali and Guinea had come into contact with the imam, whose body had been returned home and been given a ritual Muslim funeral.Mr. Ban said that a team led by Dr. Chan was headed to Mali later Friday and that a new support center would be established there.Dr. Chan was blunt about the potential for a worsening in Mali.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are scaling up our action,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told reporters. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to really move with speed and scale and have a no-regret policy. What does that mean? We must smother this little fire, little smoke, before it gets out of control.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn an example of the everyday risks confronting the effort to combat Ebola in West Africa, highway robbers in Guinea seized potentially dangerous blood samples suspected of containing the virus during a taxi holdup, news reports from the country said.Health authorities in Guinea appealed to the robbers to surrender the samples, packed in a flask, which they had grabbed from a taxi passenger, a courier taking them to a laboratory for testing.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand why they stole the blood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a spokesman for the Guinea Red Cross, Faya Etienne Tolno, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps they thought there was cash hidden in the flask.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAMMAN, Jordan \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The Jordanian authorities have arrested a senior leader of the Muslim Brotherhood for criticizing the United Arab Emirates, the spokesman for the Brotherhood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political wing said Friday.The deputy head of the Muslim Brotherhood, Zaki Bani Rushaid, was detained Thursday after a meeting at the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s headquarters in Amman, the Jordanian capital, said the spokesman for the Islamic Action Front, Murad Adayleh. It was the first arrest of a prominent opposition figure in recent years. The state security prosecutor general ordered Mr. Bani Rushaid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrest on charges of harming relations with a friendly country, according to Brotherhood officials and local media reports citing unnamed government officials.In an opinion article published this week on websites and social media sites, Mr. Bani Rushaid accused the Emirates of sponsoring terrorism and questioned the legitimacy of its rulers. Last Saturday, the Emirates formally designated the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization.The Brotherhood issued a statement shortly after Mr. Bani Rushaid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrest demanding his immediate release. The group is Jordan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main opposition party, but unlike Egypt, Jordan has long accepted the Brotherhood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence."

Thus, using a `for-loop` allows for the programatic creation of different URLs. Some sample code is below."

      "Getting back on topic, it is often more difficult than the above to iterate over numerous webpages within a site. This is where the `Scrapy` library comes in. `Scrapy` allows for the creation of web spiders that crawl over a webpage, following any links that it finds. This is often far more difficult to implement than a simple scraper since it requires the identification of rules for link following. The [State Department](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2012/index.htm) offers a good example. I don't really have time to go into the depths of writing a `Scrapy` spider, but I thought I would put up some code to illustrate what it looks like."

Also, some web programmers can't seem to decide how they want to structure the pages they write, so they just change the HTML every few pages. Notice that for the NYT example if `articleBody` gets changed to `articleBody1`, everything breaks. There are ways around this that are often convoluted, messy, and hackish. Usually, however, where there is a will there is a way.\n",
